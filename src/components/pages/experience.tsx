      Young Women in Computing, or YWiC, is an outreach organization within the computer science department of New Mexico State University (NMSU) that provides computer science outreach programs with the mission of promoting increased interest in technology careers from underrepresented groups.

      In addition, it provides services such as tutoring and network event hosting to the students of the NMSU computer science department. 

      In this capacity, I was responsible for creating and teaching curriculum in a wide variety of computer science topics, ranging anywhere from creating a game to creating a personal website to creating wearable e-textiles.

      A major accomplishment of mine was in spearheading the rapid migration of the program's computer science summer camp to an onine setting in the wake of COVID-19 lockdowns.
